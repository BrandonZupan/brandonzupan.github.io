# Gear
I currently have a DSLR and a film camera. I also have an iPhone 13 mini

## EOS 50D
My main camera is an EOS 50D. I primarily use the Canon EF-S 55-250mm 
f/4.0-5.6 IS II lens. I highly recommend it if you are looking for an entry 
level zoom lens. I also use an EF 50mm. 

## Canon AV-1
Film wise, I have a Canon AV-1 with a 50mm lens. I like to play with many 
different films
